### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
For this project, I focused on ensuring smooth data loading and creating a well-rounded app. My primary goal was to lay a strong foundation, ensuring that all aspects of the app functioned properly. This included making sure data was loaded efficiently, the app was responsive, and that everything was well-integrated and performing as expected.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent approximately **4-5 hours** working on this project. The time was mainly spent on coding, testing, and refining the app to ensure smooth data loading. The focus was on laying a strong foundation and ensuring that all components worked together.
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I made a few key trade-offs to prioritize functionality and ease of use:
  
- **Data loading vs. UI perfection**: I decided to optimize data loading for performance, even if it meant making small sacrifices in the visual polish of certain UI elements. This was done to provide users with a smoother experience.

These decisions helped maintain a solid app foundation while balancing development time and functionality.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I believe the weakest part of the project is the testing. While I made sure the app was functional and responsive, I didn't dedicate enough time to writing comprehensive tests. As a result, some areas of the app are not fully tested.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
One of the main constraints I encountered during development was the limited time available, which affected how extensively I could test the app and how much time I spent on the UI.

Focusing on building a solid foundation for the app allowed me to address key features effectively, with more time, I would focus more on expanding functionality and testing to ensure everything works as expected with different network conditions.
